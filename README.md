# GraphQL Server

This is a GraphQL API which fetches data from an in-memory database to demonstrate what this library can do to reduce the amount of requests needed to get resourcers from a server.

# Getting started
Clone this repository:
```
git clone ...
```

Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Run server:
```
npm run devStart
```
This project doesn't have a frontend url, but it has a GraphiQL interface at (http://localhost:5000/graphql) once the server is running. You can use GraphiQL to test queries as demonstrated in the screenshots bellow.
